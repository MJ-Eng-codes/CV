                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a tech enthusiast and student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. 
                    I enjoy troubleshooting Windows errors and have successfully resolved many without breaking my laptop!
                </p><p>
                    I started programming in 2023 with a 5-day challenge from Code Institute and am currently enhancing 
                    my skills through the Fullstack .NET program at Chas Academy, working with C#, T-SQL, and CSS.
                </p><p>
                    Before this, I worked as a Certified Prosthetist Orthotist (CPO), where I analyzed gait discrepancies, 
                    solved complex problems, and collaborated with patients to select effective assistive devices. 
                    This experience sharpened my analytical thinking and communication skills, which have greatly benefited my programming studies.
                </p><p>
                    Moving to Sweden has expanded my cultural understanding and made me more open-minded. 
                    Learning Swedish has further enriched my experience, improving my ability to connect with people and adapt to new environments. 
                    I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenges that push my skills further.
